## Reverb Calculator 

**version 1.0.0** 

This is a web app that helps music producers decide the reverb parameters for their track. The user simply inputs the track's BPM, and the app displays the ideal time for all the dimensions of the reverb to run. The user can then copy these values into their track's reverb settings.
